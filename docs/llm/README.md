# LLM and Agent Documentation

This directory holds documentation about Flouri’s use of LLMs and the agent layer.

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [analysis-and-roadmap.md](analysis-and-roadmap.md) | **Critical analysis** of the LLM integration (gaps, doc vs code mismatches, design flaws) and a concrete roadmap of what would need to change |
| [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) | **Milestones and release plan**: GitHub milestone titles/descriptions and versioned release scope (v0.2.0–v0.5.0) for tracking and shipping |

For high-level architecture and data flow, see [../architecture.md](../architecture.md). Note: the architecture doc’s description of confirmation flow and security does not match the current implementation; see the critical analysis for the actual behavior. For third-party stack (Google ADK, LiteLLM), see [../third-party-libraries.md](../third-party-libraries.md).
