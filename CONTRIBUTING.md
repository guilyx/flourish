## Extending Flourish with Plugins

Flourish has a powerful plugin system that allows you to add custom commands, aliases, and behaviors. See [docs/plugins.md](docs/plugins.md) for detailed information on creating plugins.

### Quick Plugin Example

```python
from flourish.plugins import Plugin
from typing import Any

class MyPlugin(Plugin):
    def name(self) -> str:
        return "my_plugin"

    def should_handle(self, command: str) -> bool:
        return command.startswith("mycommand")

    async def execute(self, command: str, cwd: str) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return {
            "handled": True,
            "output": "Plugin executed!",
            "exit_code": 0,
        }
```

For more details, see the [Plugin System Documentation](docs/plugins.md).

## Review Process

1. All PRs require at least one approval
